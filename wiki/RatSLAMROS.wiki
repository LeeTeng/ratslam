#labels RatSLAM,ROS
The ROS version of RatSLAM is intended for publication in a special open-source issue of Autonomous Robots. It has been designed as a more modular version than the other library in this project - the algorithm has been divided into 3 individual ROS nodes.

This version of RatSLAM was based on the RatSLAM C++ library written by David Ball and Scott Heath, with support and additions by Michael Milford. The RatSLAM algorithm was originally designed and implemented by Michael Milford and Gordon Wyeth.

The ROS version of RatSLAM has only been tested on Ubuntu and as ROS support for platforms other than Linux is still limited, this will probably not change.

For a full description of ROS terminology have a look [http://www.ros.org here]. 

==Dependencies==

The ROS version of RatSLAM depends on ROS dependencies:
opencv2 and topological_nav_msgs
and also on [http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net Irrlicht]
Irrlicht may be installed on Ubuntu with apt-get
{{{
sudo apt-get install libirrlicht-dev
}}}

==Build Instructions==

Checkout the source from svn:

{{{
svn checkout http://ratslam.googlecode.com/svn/branches/ratslam_ros ratslam_ros
}}}

Setup ROS environment variables by typing something like:
{{{
. /opt/ros/diamondback/setup.sh
}}}

Make sure ratslam_ros is in a directory on the environment variable ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

Then build ratslam_ros with
{{{
rosmake
}}}

==Running RatSLAM==

To use one of our pre-packaged bag files, download the bag file for either:
 * iRat in Aus
 * Car in St Lucia

both are available [https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/OpenRatSLAM+datasets here]

and place the dataset in the ratslam_ros directory.

Run the dataset and RatSLAM by typing either
{{{
roslaunch irataus.launch
rosbag play irat_aus_28112011.bag
}}}
or
{{{
roslaunch stlucia.launch
rosbag play stlucia_2007.bag
}}}
